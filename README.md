# Beginner-Friendly-Projects
These are Fifty Beginner Friendly projects that I'll be doing over a period of time, using the python programming language. It is for my own record, but I hope it helps anyone who comes across it too!

Code 1: To-do list.
To run this code, save it in a file with a .py extension (e.g., todo_list.py), and execute it using a Python interpreter. 
The program will display a menu with options to add tasks, view tasks, save tasks to a file, load tasks from a file, and exit the program. 
Each option corresponds to a specific function in the code. You can customize the code further or add additional functionality as you learn more. 
Enjoy learning Python!
